## Externs

Further API documentation for 
**haxe JS** libraries and externs will be added here in the future.

In general, the API in **haxe** will mirror the original API in Javascript, but sometimes there are minor differences. If you have any questions, please visit our [community](http://www.haxejs.org/community) and ask. We would be glad to help however we can!
