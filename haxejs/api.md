## Haxe JS API

You can find more information regarding the core language API, here: [http://api.haxe.org/js/](http://api.haxe.org/js/)

## Javascript?

If you really don't know what it is, or how it works I really can't help you.
I am not going to explain javascript to you because that would be to much (and not what this documentation is about).

Perhaps you should check:

* <http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/javascript/>
* [w3schools](http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp)


Al you learn there about javascript is aplayable here! 

## Javascript Externs

Most of the externs can be found on [haxelib](http://lib.haxe.org/).  
Just check under the tag ["js"](http://lib.haxe.org/t/js/) (not all libs metioned there are externs) of ["extern"](http://lib.haxe.org/t/extern) (not all libs mentioned there are js externs)

In general, the API in Haxe will mirror the original API in Javascript, but sometimes there are minor differences.  
If you have any questions, please get in contact with the maintainer of the lib We would be glad to help however we can!

#### For example 
A very popular javascript library is pixi.js.  

The pixi.js extern can be downloaded via:
```
haxelib install pixijs
```  

And if you visit the page on [lib.haxe.org](http://lib.haxe.org/p/pixijs/) you can read more about the pixijs extern.   
**For example:** the maintainer is [Adi Reddy Mora aka adireddy](http://lib.haxe.org/u/adireddy), how to install it (haxelib) where the original open source files are located ([github](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi-haxe)), instructions and lots more.
