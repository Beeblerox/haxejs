You can find more information regarding the core language API, here:

[http://api.haxe.org/js/](http://api.haxe.org/js/)

Read more about Haxe and javascript in the manual:
[http://haxe.org/manual/target-javascript.html](http://haxe.org/manual/target-javascript.html)

## Javascript Externs

Most of the externs can be found on [haxelib](http://lib.haxe.org/)
Just check under the tag ["js"](http://lib.haxe.org/t/js/) (not all libs metioned there are externs) of ["extern"](http://lib.haxe.org/t/extern) (not all libs mentioned there are js externs)

In general, the API in Haxe will mirror the original API in Javascript, but sometimes there are minor differences. 
If you have any questions, please get in contact with the maintainer of the lib We would be glad to help however we can!

**For example**: a very popular javascript library is pixi.js.
The pixi.js extern are [here](http://lib.haxe.org/p/pixijs/), the maintainer is [Adi Reddy Mora aka adireddy](http://lib.haxe.org/u/adireddy) 
and lots of more info (like github, install, examples).
