# Javascript Reloaded

**haxe JS** is similar to Javascript, but includes new features like:

*   Strong typing
*   Type inference
*   Packages
*   Classes
*   Interfaces
*   Generics
*   Enums
*   Iterators
*   Inlining
*   Macros

# Cross-Browser Compliant

**haxe JS** works with current browsersâ€”even Internet Explorer!

## Small Footprint

**haxe JS** relies on a small 8KB (3KB zipped) standard library and only includes the classes you use in your project.

# Familiar Syntax

New languages like CoffeeScript and Dart throw out familiar syntax for "better" syntax. We like ECMAscript. You can write strings, objects, arrays, functions and many other elements just like you could in Javascript.

## Code Completion

Ever wanted a code editor that can help think for you? **haxe JS** supports automatic code completion. Even when you do not type your variables, **haxe JS** applies type inference to provide fast and accurate feedback on every API.

## Find Errors Fast

Through code completion, you can receive instant feedback to help prevent errors before they begin. If you still make a mistake, many errors can be discovered in your code editor, so you can find and fix errors fast, before you load the browser.

## Include Regular Javascript

You do not need to change everything from Javascript to **haxe JS**: they can work together. You can reference Javascript untyped, or have extern classes to provide code completion for Javascript written outside of **haxe JS**.

## Free and Open Source

**haxe JS** is free, and most of the libraries are MIT- or BSD-licensed. You can build non-profit or commercial projects without being encumbered by restrictive licenses, no attribution required.

## Use Popular Frameworks

Using externs, **haxe JS** supports jQuery, and even more libraries through `haxelib`, like Enyo, Node.js, Jo or three.js.
