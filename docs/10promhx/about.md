# About Promise

>
Promhx is a [promise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises) and [functional reactive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming) library for Haxe. The "promise" and "stream" variables contain values that are not immediately available. However, you can specify callback functions that will trigger when the values do become available.
