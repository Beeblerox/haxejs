# Haxe and Javascript

![Haxe logo](img/haxe_javascript_logos.png) 

There used to be a website that got you started with Haxd and Js (really old, when Haxe was spelled "haXe") .

But that is no more. So I decided to get some of that back.
Based upon the information from the old site and my own need to document this.

###How will this help me?

It will get you started with javascript **and** Haxe.
How to setup your project, install externs and how to work with them. This probably will never be a complete documentation but it will help you get started!

###For who is this?

Probably for javascript developers who already started with Haxe.
Developers who know that javascript sucks for bigger projects.
Developers who have tried CoffeeScript and TypeScript.
Javascript developers who write more then a half a dozen classes.


## Documentation goals

I wanted to make contributing to this documentation as easy as possible.  
That's why I use Markdown; developers use it, but is really just plane English so **everybody** can write documentation!  
And this documentation hosted on Github, developers favorite place to store code.  
Even if you are not a developer and/or don't want to clone everything, you still can modify the files on the website (you need account to login in and change the `.md` files).


## Open-sourcing the documentation

I thought I was the first to try to write documentation this way, but other beat me.  
Although my idea was formed by writing a book in Markdown (Gitbook, but there are others).
Writing documentation is very similar to writing a book.
